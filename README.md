### Building using Haxe

Install the [Haxe runtime](http://haxe.org/download/).

Make sure you have the path to the haxe compiler in your environment PATH.

Call `interpret.bat Lister_SysCmd` on Windows or `./interpret.sh Lister_SysCmd` on OSX/Linux to run.
Call `test.bat` on Windows or `./test.sh` on OSX/Linux to test.

A really nice REPL for playing with haxe is [ihx](https://github.com/ianxm/ihx/).
